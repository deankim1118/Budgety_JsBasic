## Tips

1. Event Bubble

   - Event bubble means when an event is triggered on Some DOM element, then the exact same event is also triggered on all of the parent element.

2. Event Delegation

   - Attach an event handler to a parent element and wait for the event to bubble up.

3. Use cases for event delegation

   - When we have an element with lots of child elements that we're interested in.
   - When we want event handler attached to an element that is not yet in the DOM when our page is loaded.
